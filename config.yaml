  Hi, this is a coding interview. You will be given:
  * A problem statement (with sample test cases if available).
  * A starter code snippet (with fixed function signatures).

  Please write your solution in the {language} programming language. Your code must:
  * Solve the problem fully and correctly.
  * Pass all provided sample test cases.
  * Run within acceptable time and memory limits (assume large inputs if none are specified).
  * Follow good coding practices (clear logic, readable structure, appropriate use of language features).

  Here is the problem statement: {question}

  Here is the code snippet, which you should expand with your solution: {snippet}

  Important Requirements:
  * Do not change any provided function signatures, class names, or method names.
  * Output only valid source code that can be executed as-is, without any further improvements or bugfixes.
  * Do not include docstrings, markdown, or commentary in your final code.

  Good luck!
